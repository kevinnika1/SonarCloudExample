# SonarCloud Example end to end CI/CD pipeline

Implementing all the nessacry security testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline of an example python containersied web application. This example uses Sonarcloud as the SAST tool and aims to integrate all the tools into GitHub in a clear and efficeint way for Developers. This includes outputting all the results of the tools in githubs "checks/annotaions" feature so that they never have to leave GitHub and Sign into other tools for the results.  

This Pipeline includes other actions that I have made to improve on the integrations of some of the security tools. This was mainly done to imporve the output of results from the security tests.
